        6.3 The Buyer agrees it is solely responsible for determining the acceptability of the Software (including but not limited to its functionality and operational capability) for its purposes and the Seller relies on the Buyer’s determination to perform the services.<br />
        6.4 The Buyer agrees to ensure the Seller is permitted to use any third party information or intellectual property rights the Buyer requires the Seller to use to perform any of the services including but not limited to implementation of the Software.<br />
        6.5 The Seller’s performance depends on the Buyer also performing its obligations.

        6.9 The Seller may, at its discretion, require the Buyer to approve each phase or step upon completion of the services for a phase or step. Where the Buyer has approved a phase or step, such approval will be considered by the Seller as irrevocable acceptance by the Buyer of the completion of that phase or step.<br />
        6.10 After acceptance of a phase or step, if the Buyer requires any further work including any changes to be undertaken in relation to a completed phase or step, such work will be treated, at the discretion of the Seller, as additional services and charged in accordance with the rates given in the table above or the SOW or as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, or as a variation of these terms and conditions.<br />
        6.11 The supply of services is subject to availability of resources. If the unavailability of resources will adversely impact any of the phases or steps, the Seller will advise the Buyer of any such impact and the phases or steps in the SOW will deemed to be amended in accordance with any such advice.<br />
        6.12 The Seller must provide the services during normal working hours or such other times as agreed between the parties. The Buyer must provide adequate and safe facilities for the Seller if the Seller is to provide any of the services at the Buyer’s premises.<br />

      7.2 Any claim that the goods or services are not in accordance with these terms and conditions or the SOWs (including if they are damaged during delivery, short delivered or not working, functioning or operable) must be made in writing to the Buyer within 7 days of delivery, installation, implementation or provision of the goods and/or the services (as applicable).<br />
      7.3 If the Buyer fails to make such claim within 7 days of delivery of the goods and/or the services (as applicable), then to the extent permitted by law, the goods and/or services are deemed to have been accepted by the Buyer and the Buyer must pay for the goods and/or services in accordance with the provisions of these terms and conditions.<br />
      8 PAYMENT<br />
      8.1 Subject to clauses 8.2 to 8.4, payment for goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer must be cash on delivery (“COD”).<br />
      8.2 If the Seller has accepted and approved an application for commercial credit made by the Buyer and granted the Buyer an approved credit limit, the Buyer must make each payment for the goods and services within 30 days of the date of invoice (or such other period as agreed by the parties in writing).<br />
      8.3 If the Seller has accepted and approved an application for finance from the Buyer, the Buyer must make payment for the goods and services in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the financing arrangement in the form of a Rental Agreement, Lease Agreement or Copy Plan Agreement.<br />
      8.4 If the Seller has agreed to payment by credit card, the Buyer must make payment for the goods and services immediately upon receipt of invoice.<br />
      8.5 Invoices must be paid in full without set-off or deduction.<br />
      8.6 Time is of the essence in respect of the Buyer’s obligation to make payment for the goods and services.<br />
      8.7 Notwithstanding that the Seller may have granted the Buyer an approved credit limit or finance, upon the occurrence of any of the following events, all amounts owing by the Buyer (including any amounts owing but not yet due) will become immediately due and payable:<br />
      (1) a breach of these terms and conditions by the Buyer;<br />
      (2) an Insolvency Event occurs in relation to the Buyer; or<br />
      (3) any event occurs which in the reasonable opinion of the Seller is likely to adversely affect the ability of the Buyer to perform its obligations under these terms and conditions.<br />
      8.8 Upon the occurrence of any of the events in clause 8.7, the Seller may also in its absolute discretion:<br />
      (1) vary or withdraw any approved credit limit;<br />
      (2) cancel any unfilled orders; and<br />
      (3) require the Buyer to reimburse the Seller for all collection costs including legal costs incurred by the Seller on a full indemnity basis in connection with the default and/or to institute such recovery process as the Seller in its discretion decides.<br />
      8.9 Any payment by the Buyer to the Seller may be applied by the Seller against monies owing by the Buyer in such manner as the Seller sees fit.<br />
      9 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX<br />
      9.1 In these terms and conditions “GST” means GST as defined in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 as amended from time to time (“GST Act”) or any replacement or other relevant legislation and regulations.<br />
      9.2 Unless GST is expressly included, the price payable for any supply made under or in connection with these terms and conditions does not include GST.<br />
      9.3 To the extent that any supply is a taxable supply, the GST exclusive consideration otherwise payable for that supply is increased by the amount of any GST payable in respect of that taxable supply, and that amount is payable at the same time as the GST exclusive consideration.<br />
      9.4 Each party agrees to do all things, including providing tax invoices and other documentation, that may be necessary to enable the other party to claim any input tax credit, adjustment or refund in relation to any amount of GST paid or payable.<br />
      10 INTEREST<br />
      10.1 The Seller may charge the Buyer interest on overdue accounts issued under these terms and conditions at the reference rate for its Australian trading bank on unsecured overdraft facilities.
      10.2 Interest is charged from the date the payment was due until the date payment is made.<br />
      11 RISK AND INSURANCE<br />
      11.1 Goods supplied by the Seller to the Buyer are at the Buyer’s risk immediately on delivery to the Buyer.<br />
      11.2 The Buyer must insure the goods at its cost from the time of delivery of the goods until they are paid for in full against such risks as it reasonably thinks appropriate and must note the interest of the Seller on the policy and produce a certificate to this effect to the Seller on request.<br />
      12 RETENTION OF TITLE <br />
      The following provisions do not apply to the goods to the extent a Rental Agreement, Lease Agreement or Copy Plan Agreement also applies to those goods. Relevant provisions pertaining to the PPSA in relation to those goods are contained within each of those agreements.<br />
      12.1 In this clause 12:<br />
      (1) PPSA means Personal Property Securities Act 2009 (Cth); and<br />
      (2) a term that is used in italics in this clause 12 has the same meaning as in the PPSA.<br />
      12.2 Subject to clause 4.1 and the preservation of the Seller’s rights under the PPSA in respect of the Software, property in the goods supplied by the Seller to the Buyer under these terms and conditions does not pass to the Buyer until those goods, and any goods previously supplied, have been paid for in full. The Buyer in the meantime takes custody of the goods and retains them as the fiduciary agent and bailee of the Seller. 12.3 Until the goods have been paid for in full, the Buyer must:<br />
      (1) store the goods in such manner as to show clearly that they are the property of the Seller;<br />
      (2) keep the goods fully insured at the Buyer’s cost and hold the proceeds of any insurance claim in respect of the goods (to the extent of the Buyer’s debt to the Seller) in trust for the Seller;<br />
