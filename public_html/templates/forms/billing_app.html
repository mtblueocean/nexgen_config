                    billing in respect of any billing period and to add the charges incurred to any subsequent
                    billing period. We try to include all charges relating to a billing period on that bill. Where
                    that does not happen, bills may include charges from previous billing periods as long as we

                    4.3 Method of Invoice: The Nexgen invoice is electronically billed as an attachment to an email. If you

                    your bill is paid by credit card, we can charge you a payment processing fee. Refer to your

                    Other Supplier charges to us because you approach that Other Supplier directly, or, other-
                    wise than through us. (b) You will pay to us in accordance with Clause 4 any charges which
                    any Other Supplier or other Person charges to us for connection or initiation of any Service
                    or for cancellation of any Service.</br>
                    4.9 Overdue Amounts: If you do not pay your bill by its due date, we can charge you an

                    4.10 Disputed Amounts: We are required by various industry codes to ensure that our bills
                    are accurate and verifiable, and we are committed to complying with these requirements.
                    Our records are sufficient proof that a charge is payable unless they are shown to be incorrect. In the event that a bill is disputed by you, you agree to pay to us all amounts payable
                    pursuant to the disputed bill without deduction or set-off and we agree to refund any monies

                    re-ferred to in this Clause 4, are several and independent from your or our obligations under
