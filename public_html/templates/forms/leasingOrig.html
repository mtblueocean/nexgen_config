          <b><i>Privacy Act 1988 (as amended, effective 12 March 2014)</i></b>
      <p class='details-small bigger'>
        The clauses below describe how Nexgen Equipment Rentals ABN 24147357962 
        (“we”/“us”) may collect, use, handle and disclose your personal 
        information. They also describe the privacy‐related matters to which you
        give your consent in applying for a Lease, lease facility from us. Your
        personal information will be treated in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988
        (“Privacy Act”) as well as the Credit Reporting Privacy Code. <br/>
        (a) The clauses below set out: <br />
        (i) Consents that you give us in relation to your personal information 
        by applying for finance from us or otherwise in connection with credit that we <br/>
        offer; and <br/>
        (ii) Important information about our collection, use, disclosure and management 
        of your personal information. <br/><br/>
        <b>Collection of your personal information</b><br/><br/>
        (b) We will ordinarily collect your personal information about you for the following purposes, and to the extent not already authorised by law, you 
        agree to us using and disclosing that information for these purposes. This is dependent on the circumstances and the nature and products and 
        services you are obtaining from us.<br/>
        (i) assessing and processing existing or future application(s) for credit and, where applicable, insurance or extended warranty products, managing 
        your account or other products, responding to your questions and performing our obligations in relation to credit and insurance products provided 
        to you; <br/>
        (ii) protecting us and our assets (including against fraud) and selling
        our assets (including by assigning any debts); <br/>
        (iii) enforcing our rights (including undertaking debt collection) in connection
        with any credit provided to you; <br/>
        (iv) considering any variation requests; <br/>
        (v) managing, changing and improving our systems and processes; <br/>
        (vi) complying with laws. Various Australian laws may require us to collect
        your personal information, or we may need to do so to be able to 
        comply with other obligations under those laws. These laws include: the Anti‐Money Laundering and Counter‐Terrorism Financing Act and other 
        anti‐money laundering legislation (for example, for identity verification), the National Consumer Credit Protection Act (for example, for responsible 
        lending), the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act, the Corporations Act (Cth) and other regulatory legislation (for example, requiring us to 
        maintain client and transaction records, to provide information relating to loans to APRA and to make reports and provide other information to 
        regulators such as ASIC) and the Taxation Administration Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and other taxation laws (for example, to comply with 
        information requests issued by the Commissioner of Taxation); <br/>
        (vii) marketing products and services provided by us and our related entities; <br/>
        (viii) developing an understanding of goods and services you may be
        interested in receiving from us and related entities; <br/>
        (ix) compiling statistical data e.g. credit scoring information. <br/>
        (c ) We collect your personal information primarily from you. However, sometimes we may collect personal information about you from third 
        parties for the purposes described above where it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect it directly from you. For example, even though your 
        application is for Commercial credit, we may collect information about you from a business which provides information about consumer credit 
        worthiness for the purpose of assessing your application. Other third parties that we may collect your information from include the supplier of the 
        Equipment; our agents; other credit providers; insurers, any of your employers, former employers, referees, banks, landlords, guarantors, 
        accountants, lawyers and financial advisers; your executor, administrator or attorney; service providers to us (including debt collection agencies, 
        introducers, private investigators, professional advisers); professional organisations; internet sources; public and subscriber only databases; credit 
        reporting bodies, any person considering purchasing the business or any credit facility (or any part of the business or credit facility) the subject of 
        any of our products or to any person to whom we may assign your credit contract/s (and their advisors and representatives); any person 
        considered necessary in our view to execute your instructions; and government authorities. The circumstances in which we may do so include, for 
        example, where we need information from a third party to assist us to deal with any application or request made by you (such as to verify 
        information you have provided or to assess your circumstances) or to
        assist us to locate or communicate with you. <br/>
        (d) The consequences of you not providing to us the personal information that we require can include that we will not be able to approve your 
        application for credit or a related product, or that we will not be able to deal with future requests or queries from you in connection with credit we 
        provide. <br/>
        (e) You agree that we can disclose your personal information (including, where permitted to do so under the Privacy Act, your credit information 
        and credit eligibility information) for the purposes described above to: <br/>
        (i) your co‐applicant (if any); any of our related bodies corporate; our assignees or potential assignees; the supplier of any goods or services 
        financed with credit we provide; any other supplier appointed by us, credit reporting bodies or any business providing information about 
        commercial credit worthiness; other credit providers; card issuers; your assignees or proposed assignees; debt collection agencies; banks and 
        financial advisers; lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers; any suppliers or contractors to us who need to have access to our 
        personal information for the purpose of providing services to us or you (including, without limitation, velures, physical and electronic file storage 
        suppliers, receivables management suppliers and data warehouses); 
        any person specifically authorised by you in writing: <br/>
        (ii) any person as permitted or required by law.<br/> <br/>
        <b>We may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients</b><br/><br/>
        (f) Some of the organisations to whom we may disclose your personal information (including your credit information or credit eligibility 
        information) will be located overseas and may not have an Australian link. The countries in which overseas recipients are likely to be located 
        currently include the Philippines and New Zealand (for an updated list of countries from time to time please see our Privacy Policy and Credit 
        Reporting Policy available on our website).You acknowledge that by consenting to us disclosing your personal information to overseas recipients, 
        Australian Privacy Principle (“APP”) <br/>
        8.1 will not apply to the disclosure (which means that we will not be obliged under the Privacy Act to take reasonable steps to ensure that an 
        overseas recipient does not breach the APPs and we may not be liable under the Privacy Act if the recipient does not act consistently with the 
        APPs). By applying for this product you consent to disclosures to overseas recipients. <br/>

        <b>Important information about credit reporting </b><br/><br/>
        (g) Our website at <a href="www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au">www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au</a> contains important information about credit reporting, including the credit reporting 
        bodies that we deal with, credit information that we may give them about you (such as about defaults and serious credit infringements) and details 
        regarding how those credit reporting bodies use and disclose that information to credit providers and their policies about managing the
        information. You have important rights regarding access, correction and complaints relating to your credit reporting information, as well as certain 
      rights to prevent its use for direct marketing or where you have been a victim of fraud. You will also find details about these rights on the same 
      page. You can also ask us to provide you with a copy of this important information. <br/>
      (h) You also agree that we or any credit provider we choose can obtain, 
      from any business providing information about commercial credit 
      worthiness, consumer and or commercial credit reports about you for the purposes of 
      assessing applications for commercial credit <br/>
      (i) You agree that we can disclose your name, residential address and date of birth
      to a credit reporting body so that the credit reporting body can 
      provide an assessment to us of whether the information provided by you matches (in whole or in part) the information in the credit reporting 
      body’s possession or control (which may include personal information held by the credit reporting body about you or other individuals). This will 
      be done for the purpose of verifying your identity as required under Australia’s anti‐money laundering and counter‐terrorism laws where 
      applicable. If you would prefer us to use another form of verification, such as your passport or driver’s licence, you must notify us and provide us 
      with any information that we request. <br/><br/>
      <b>Marketing products and services to you </b></br><br/>
      (j) You agree to us using and disclosing your personal information (including your telephone number, regardless of whether it is listed on the Do 
      Not Call Register and your email or other electronic addresses) to provide you with information about our other products and services and the 
      products and services offered by our dealers, insurers (such as insurers who provide credit‐related insurance), our related companies or suppliers. 
      This includes, without limitation, communicating with you via emails, text messages or other electronic messages (without an unsubscribe facility). 
      This agreement operates indefinitely. However, you can tell us that you no longer wish us to use or disclose your personal information for these 
      purposes by contacting us on 1300 763 738 <br/><br/>
      <b>Information about other persons </b><br/><br/>
      (k) If you provide information about any other person, such as a referee, you agree
      to tell them: <br/>
      (i) that you are providing this information to us; (ii) of our contact details on 
      this form; <br/>
      (ii) the reason you are providing their information; <br/><br/>
      <b>Electronic communication </b><br/><br/>
      (l) To protect your privacy, we recommend that any email address you provide to us be your personal email address rather than, for example, an 
      email address accessible by your work colleagues or family members. </br>
      <b>Your access to personal Information correction and complaints </b><br/>
      (m) You have rights to request access to, or correction of, personal information that we hold about you, including credit‐related information. You 
      also have rights to make a complaint if you consider that we have not complied with the Privacy Act or Credit Reporting Privacy Code in relation to 
      our information. Our Privacy Policy and Credit Reporting Policy  <a href="www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au">www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au</a>

                    Financier a completed Lease Schedule in the form of the Schedule or

                    in respect of a Lease transaction.<br /> 
                    1.2 The submission of a Schedule by a Customer will constitute an 
                    irrevocable offer from that Customer to Lease (an “Offer”), for the

                    Offer, by signing the relevant Schedule, even if the Customer has

                    Customer must comply with its obligations under this Agreement,

                    (d) anything else in relation to this document or any transaction under 
                    this document. <br /><br />

                    <b>D 4. Warranties</b> <br />
                    4.1 When the Customer submits a Schedule, the Customer warrants 
                    that: <br />
                    (a) all information referred to in that Schedule and each document

                    Schedule is complete, correct and up to date; and <br />
                    (b) the execution and performance of this document and each

                   registration, or any response to an amendment demand or a request

                    payment or claim any deduction or set‐off.<br/> <br/>

                    owner of the Goods is noted on all insurances. The Customer must 
                    provide to the Financier on demand a certificate of currency in 
                    relation to the insurances which is satisfactory to the Financier and 
                    must ensure nothing is done or occurs which might prejudice or 
                    invalidate any insurances. The Financier may in its discretion, at any 
                    time, at the expense of the Customer, effect any insurances 
                    contemplated by this Agreement in its own name and on its own 
                    behalf including as an addition to the acquisition cost of the Goods. <br />
                    6.3 The Financier is entitled to receive all amounts payable under any 
                    relevant insurance of the Goods or by any other person in respect of 
                    damage to, or loss of, the Goods and the Customer irrevocably 
                    appoints the Financier and each of its authorised representatives, as 
                    attorney for the Customer to recover or compromise in the respective 
                    names of the Financier and the Customer any claim for loss or damage 
                    under any of the insurances, and to give effectual rerentals and 
                    receipts. The Customer also irrevocably authorises the Financier to 
                    apply any insurance or other moneys received (less any GST) in 
                    respect of any loss of, or damage to, the Goods towards any debt or 
                    liability, present or future, actual or contingent, of the Customer to 
                    the Financier or, in the discretion of the Financier, to repairing such 
                    damage or replacing the Goods. <br />
                    To the extent that those insurance moneys may be insufficient to 
                    affect such repairs, the Customer must apply its own moneys for this 
                    purpose. <br />
                    6.4 The Customer must promptly notify the Financier if the Goods are 
                    lost, stolen or damaged. <br /><br />
                    <b>7. Indemnities & Releases</b> <br />
                    7.1 The Customer indemnifies the Financier, its agents, contractors 
                    and employees against all loss (including loss of bargain or profit), 
                    damage, liabilities, costs, taxes, charges and expenses (including legal

                    (b) must do everything necessary to protect the title of the Financier

                        Acceptance Date, then the Customer also agrees to rent the Goods 
                        from the Financier during the period from the Acceptance Date to the

                        entering into this Agreement in reliance on this Guarantee and 
                        Indemnity from the Guarantor. <br />
                        19.2 In consideration of the Financier agreeing to enter into this 
                        Agreement with the Customer the Guarantor guarantees that the 
                        Customer will pay the Financier all amounts payable by the Customer 
                        under this Agreement from time to time (which includes without 
                        limitation each Schedule accepted by the Financier). This Guarantee 
                        and Indemnity continues until all these amounts have been paid in 
                        full. Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the 
                        Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this Guarantee and 
                        Indemnity extends to each Schedule accepted by the Financier and all 
                        obligations and liabilities of the Customer arising in connection with 
                        those Schedules (Regardless of whether or not the Guarantor was 
                        aware of such Schedules or otherwise). <br />
                        19.3 If the Financier asks, the Guarantor must pay the Financier any 
                        amount which the Customer does not pay the Customer when it is 
                        due under this Agreement. The Financier does not need to first ask 
                        the Customer to pay the Financier. <br />
                        19.4 The Guarantor indemnifies the Financier against, and the

                        suffers or incurs if: <br />
                        (a) the Customer does not, is not obliged to, or is unable to, pay the 
                        Financier in accordance with this Agreement; or <br />
                        (b) the Guarantor is not obliged to pay the Financier an amount under 
                        clauses 19.2 and 19.3; or <br />
                        (c) the Financier is obliged, or the Financier agrees to pay an amount

                        19.5 The indemnity in clause 19.4 is a continuing obligation, separate

                        Guarantee and Indemnity. It continues after those other obligations

                        (including enforcing or taking any other action in connection with our 
                        rights) and terminating this Guarantee and Indemnity; and

                        fines and expenses in connection with them. <br />
                        19.7 The indemnity in clause 19.6 for taxes includes any amount which 
                        the Financier is obliged to pay to another person to enable that other 
                        person to pay a tax. <br />
                        19.8 The Guarantor must pay interest calculated on daily balances on 
                        any amount the Guarantor owes under clauses 19.2, 19.3, 19.4 and 
                        19.5 from the date the Financier asks the Guarantor for the amount 
                        until the Guarantor pays it. This interest is to be calculated and is 
                        payable in accordance with clause 14.7.  <br />
                        19.9 The Guarantor acknowledges that a trustee in bankruptcy, 
                        liquidator or similar person may ask the Financier to refund a payment 
                        that the Financier has received in connection with this Agreement or 
                        this Guarantee and Indemnity. To the extent the Financier is obliged

                    (such as obtaining consents, signing and producing documents and 
                    getting documents completed and signed) to bind itself under the 
                    Guarantee and Indemnity. <br />
                  
                    19.17 The Financier may claim against this Guarantor under this 
                    Guarantee and Indemnity before the Financier enforces any of its 
                    rights: <br />
                    (a) against the Customer or any other person; or <br />
                    (b) under another document such as a guarantee or mortgage, charge 
                    or other security. <br />
                    19.18 The Financier may use any money paid by or for the Customer 
                    towards meeting any part the Financier chooses of the amounts the 
                    Customer owes the Financier (including meeting any amount the 
                    Guarantor does not guarantee). The Financier may use any money 
                    paid by the Guarantor under this Guarantee and Indemnity towards 
                    paying any part the Financier chooses of the amounts the Guarantor 
                    owes the Financier under this Guarantee and Indemnity. <br />
