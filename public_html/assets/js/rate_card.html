                    All Prices exclude GST. <b>Minimum term on all Broadband plans listed above is 36months.</b> Nexgen deems one (1) Gigabyte to be equivalent to 1024 Mega bytes. Relocation of
service(s) is dependent on coverage availability. Ethernet is available in selected coverage areas only and is dependent on the access technology. Nexgen will not charge for the
upload data unless your total uploaded data usage in a calendar month exceeds the total downloaded usage in the same month by more than 2.5 times. In this case, Nexgen will
charge you for each additional Megabyte or Gigabyte of traffic you upload in that month in excess of the 2.5:1 ratio at the rate of $2.50/Gigabyte. ADSL 2+ and Midband speeds
advertised above are an <b>Up to speed.</b> These speeds may vary due to a number of factors; Eg: distance from the local telephone exchange. Professional Installation charge, if
selected will be added to the phone bill . Nexgen provides 5 emails at $0. Any additional emails supplied can be purchased at $10 per month per 5 users. This can only be
purchased in 5 user blocks. Nexgen Australia will provide a Mail box space of a 100MB. Excess Usage on the Nexgen Office Broadband plans is charged at 15c per MB. Nexgen
static IP defaults at one per client. Additional static IP's are charged at $8 per IP. Nexgen Australia will deliver the service to the site only. Your IT person is required to complete
the connection of the broadband service at your site, and the customer is liable for all and any charges associated with the use of their IT person. Early Termination Fees apply.
Please refer to clause 15.5 of the Nexgen Application and for full Terms and Conditions. Delivery of all the above services is dependant on available copper pairs on your lead in. It
is the customers responsibility to have enough copper pairs from your MDF to your comms room. A maximum of 8 copper pairs are required is required for our Midband

        (c ) We collect your personal information primarily from you. However, sometimes we may collect personal information about you from third 
        parties for the purposes described above where it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect it directly from you. For example, even though your 
        application is for Commercial credit, we may collect information about you from a business which provides information about consumer credit 
        worthiness for the purpose of assessing your application. Other third parties that we may collect your information from include the supplier of the 
        Equipment; our agents; other credit providers; insurers, any of your employers, former employers, referees, banks, landlords, guarantors, 
        accountants, lawyers and financial advisers; your executor, administrator or attorney; service providers to us (including debt collection agencies, 
        introducers, private investigators, professional advisers); professional organisations; internet sources; public and subscriber only databases; credit 
        reporting bodies, any person considering purchasing the business or any credit facility (or any part of the business or credit facility) the subject of 
        any of our products or to any person to whom we may assign your credit contract/s (and their advisors and representatives); any person 
        considered necessary in our view to execute your instructions; and government authorities. The circumstances in which we may do so include, for 
        example, where we need information from a third party to assist us to deal with any application or request made by you (such as to verify 
        information you have provided or to assess your circumstances) or to
        assist us to locate or communicate with you. <br/>
        (d) The consequences of you not providing to us the personal information that we require can include that we will not be able to approve your 
        application for credit or a related product, or that we will not be able to deal with future requests or queries from you in connection with credit we 
        provide. <br/>
        (e) You agree that we can disclose your personal information (including, where permitted to do so under the Privacy Act, your credit information 
        and credit eligibility information) for the purposes described above to: <br/>
        (i) your co‐applicant (if any); any of our related bodies corporate; our assignees or potential assignees; the supplier of any goods or services 
        financed with credit we provide; any other supplier appointed by us, credit reporting bodies or any business providing information about 
        commercial credit worthiness; other credit providers; card issuers; your assignees or proposed assignees; debt collection agencies; banks and 
        financial advisers; lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers; any suppliers or contractors to us who need to have access to our 
        personal information for the purpose of providing services to us or you (including, without limitation, velures, physical and electronic file storage 
        suppliers, receivables management suppliers and data warehouses); 
        any person specifically authorised by you in writing: <br/>
        (ii) any person as permitted or required by law.<br/> 
        <b>We may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients</b><br/>
        (f) Some of the organisations to whom we may disclose your personal information (including your credit information or credit eligibility 
        information) will be located overseas and may not have an Australian link. The countries in which overseas recipients are likely to be located 
        currently include the Philippines and New Zealand (for an updated list of countries from time to time please see our Privacy Policy and Credit 
        Reporting Policy available on our website).You acknowledge that by consenting to us disclosing your personal information to overseas recipients, 
        Australian Privacy Principle (“APP”) <br/>
        8.1 will not apply to the disclosure (which means that we will not be obliged under the Privacy Act to take reasonable steps to ensure that an 
        overseas recipient does not breach the APPs and we may not be liable under the Privacy Act if the recipient does not act consistently with the 
        APPs). By applying for this product you consent to disclosures to overseas recipients. <br/>

      assessing applications for commercial credit <br/>
      (i) You agree that we can disclose your name, residential address and date of birth
      to a credit reporting body so that the credit reporting body can 
      provide an assessment to us of whether the information provided by you matches (in whole or in part) the information in the credit reporting 
      body’s possession or control (which may include personal information held by the credit reporting body about you or other individuals). This will 
      be done for the purpose of verifying your identity as required under Australia’s anti‐money laundering and counter‐terrorism laws where 
      applicable. If you would prefer us to use another form of verification, such as your passport or driver’s licence, you must notify us and provide us 
      with any information that we request. <br/>

                    in respect of a Rental transaction.<br />

                        information under section 275(7)(d) if we approve. Nothing in this 
                        clause 14.19(c) will prevent any disclosure by the Financier if it 
                        believes it is necessary to comply with its other obligations under the

                        the kind mentioned in section 275(1) of the PPSA to the extent that

                        for by this Agreement or any Schedule, the Financier and the

                        136(3), 136(4), 136(5) and 137; and (f) if section 115(1) of the PPSA 
                        does not allow section 125 of the PPSA to be excluded, the Customer 
                        agrees that at any time after any PPS Security Interest provided for by

                        Acceptance Date, then the Customer also agrees to rent the Goods 
                        from the Financier during the period from the Acceptance Date to the 
                        Commencement Date (the “Interim Period”) and to pay to the <br />

                        the General Terms occur. If no prior notice of termination is given 
                        repossession of the Goods under this clause will itself terminate this

                        (d) pay the Financier on demand its Costs of Repossession. <br />
                        18.2 The Customer undertakes to give the Financier no more than 180

                        to the Financier in the condition required under clause 18.1(a) at the 
                        expiration of the Term and the Financier has not terminated this

                        giving the Financier one month’s notice and delivering the Goods to 
                        the Financier in the manner required under clause 18.1(a). <br />

                        clauses 18.3 and 18.4 will not affect the Financier’s ownership of the 
                        Goods or any of its rights under this Agreement. <br />

          <b><i>Privacy Act 1988 (as amended, effective 12 March 2014)</i></b>
      <p class='details-small'>
        The clauses below describe how Nexgen Equipment Rentals ABN 24147357962 
        (“we”/“us”) may collect, use, handle and disclose your personal 
        information. They also describe the privacy‐related matters to which you
        give your consent in applying for a Rental, rental facility from us. Your
        personal information will be treated in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988
        (“Privacy Act”) as well as the Credit Reporting Privacy Code. <br/>
        (a) The clauses below set out: <br />
        (i) Consents that you give us in relation to your personal information 
        by applying for finance from us or otherwise in connection with credit that we <br/>
        offer; and <br/>
        (ii) Important information about our collection, use, disclosure and management 
        of your personal information. <br/>
        <b>Collection of your personal information</b><br/>
        (b) We will ordinarily collect your personal information about you for the following purposes, and to the extent not already authorised by law, you 
        agree to us using and disclosing that information for these purposes. This is dependent on the circumstances and the nature and products and 
        services you are obtaining from us.<br/>
        (i) assessing and processing existing or future application(s) for credit and, where applicable, insurance or extended warranty products, managing 
        your account or other products, responding to your questions and performing our obligations in relation to credit and insurance products provided 
        to you; <br/>
        (ii) protecting us and our assets (including against fraud) and selling
        our assets (including by assigning any debts); <br/>
        (iii) enforcing our rights (including undertaking debt collection) in connection
        with any credit provided to you; <br/>
        (iv) considering any variation requests; <br/>
        (v) managing, changing and improving our systems and processes; <br/>
        (vi) complying with laws. Various Australian laws may require us to collect
        your personal information, or we may need to do so to be able to 
        comply with other obligations under those laws. These laws include: the Anti‐Money Laundering and Counter‐Terrorism Financing Act and other 
        anti‐money laundering legislation (for example, for identity verification), the National Consumer Credit Protection Act (for example, for responsible 
        lending), the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act, the Corporations Act (Cth) and other regulatory legislation (for example, requiring us to 
        maintain client and transaction records, to provide information relating to loans to APRA and to make reports and provide other information to 
        regulators such as ASIC) and the Taxation Administration Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and other taxation laws (for example, to comply with 
        information requests issued by the Commissioner of Taxation); <br/>
        (vii) marketing products and services provided by us and our related entities; <br/>
        (viii) developing an understanding of goods and services you may be
        interested in receiving from us and related entities; <br/>
        (ix) compiling statistical data e.g. credit scoring information. <br/>
        (c ) We collect your personal information primarily from you. However, sometimes we may collect personal information about you from third 
        parties for the purposes described above where it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect it directly from you. For example, even though your 
        application is for Commercial credit, we may collect information about you from a business which provides information about consumer credit 
        worthiness for the purpose of assessing your application. Other third parties that we may collect your information from include the supplier of the 
        Equipment; our agents; other credit providers; insurers, any of your employers, former employers, referees, banks, landlords, guarantors, 
        accountants, lawyers and financial advisers; your executor, administrator or attorney; service providers to us (including debt collection agencies, 
        introducers, private investigators, professional advisers); professional organisations; internet sources; public and subscriber only databases; credit 
        reporting bodies, any person considering purchasing the business or any credit facility (or any part of the business or credit facility) the subject of 
        any of our products or to any person to whom we may assign your credit contract/s (and their advisors and representatives); any person 
        considered necessary in our view to execute your instructions; and government authorities. The circumstances in which we may do so include, for 
        example, where we need information from a third party to assist us to deal with any application or request made by you (such as to verify 
        information you have provided or to assess your circumstances) or to
        assist us to locate or communicate with you. <br/>
        (d) The consequences of you not providing to us the personal information that we require can include that we will not be able to approve your 
        application for credit or a related product, or that we will not be able to deal with future requests or queries from you in connection with credit we 
        provide. <br/>
        (e) You agree that we can disclose your personal information (including, where permitted to do so under the Privacy Act, your credit information 
        and credit eligibility information) for the purposes described above to: <br/>
        (i) your co‐applicant (if any); any of our related bodies corporate; our assignees or potential assignees; the supplier of any goods or services 
        financed with credit we provide; any other supplier appointed by us, credit reporting bodies or any business providing information about 
        commercial credit worthiness; other credit providers; card issuers; your assignees or proposed assignees; debt collection agencies; banks and 
        financial advisers; lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers; any suppliers or contractors to us who need to have access to our 
        personal information for the purpose of providing services to us or you (including, without limitation, velures, physical and electronic file storage 
        suppliers, receivables management suppliers and data warehouses); 
        any person specifically authorised by you in writing: <br/>
        (ii) any person as permitted or required by law.<br/> 
        <b>We may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients</b><br/>
        (f) Some of the organisations to whom we may disclose your personal information (including your credit information or credit eligibility 
        information) will be located overseas and may not have an Australian link. The countries in which overseas recipients are likely to be located 
        currently include the Philippines and New Zealand (for an updated list of countries from time to time please see our Privacy Policy and Credit 
        Reporting Policy available on our website).You acknowledge that by consenting to us disclosing your personal information to overseas recipients, 
        Australian Privacy Principle (“APP”) <br/>
        8.1 will not apply to the disclosure (which means that we will not be obliged under the Privacy Act to take reasonable steps to ensure that an 
        overseas recipient does not breach the APPs and we may not be liable under the Privacy Act if the recipient does not act consistently with the 
        APPs). By applying for this product you consent to disclosures to overseas recipients. <br/>
        <b>Important information about credit reporting </b><br/>
        (g) Our website at <a href="www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au">www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au</a> contains important information about credit reporting, including the credit reporting 
        bodies that we deal with, credit information that we may give them about you (such as about defaults and serious credit infringements) and details 
        regarding how those credit reporting bodies use and disclose that information to credit providers and their policies about managing the

      <pagebreak />
      <p class="details-small">
                information. You have important rights regarding access, correction and complaints relating to your credit reporting information, as well as certain 
      rights to prevent its use for direct marketing or where you have been a victim of fraud. You will also find details about these rights on the same 
      page. You can also ask us to provide you with a copy of this important information. <br/>
      (h) You also agree that we or any credit provider we choose can obtain, 
      from any business providing information about commercial credit 
      worthiness, consumer and or commercial credit reports about you for the purposes of 
      assessing applications for commercial credit <br/>
      (i) You agree that we can disclose your name, residential address and date of birth
      to a credit reporting body so that the credit reporting body can 
      provide an assessment to us of whether the information provided by you matches (in whole or in part) the information in the credit reporting 
      body’s possession or control (which may include personal information held by the credit reporting body about you or other individuals). This will 
      be done for the purpose of verifying your identity as required under Australia’s anti‐money laundering and counter‐terrorism laws where 
      applicable. If you would prefer us to use another form of verification, such as your passport or driver’s licence, you must notify us and provide us 
      with any information that we request. <br/>
      <b>Marketing products and services to you </b></br>
      (j) You agree to us using and disclosing your personal information (including your telephone number, regardless of whether it is listed on the Do 
      Not Call Register and your email or other electronic addresses) to provide you with information about our other products and services and the 
      products and services offered by our dealers, insurers (such as insurers who provide credit‐related insurance), our related companies or suppliers. 
      This includes, without limitation, communicating with you via emails, text messages or other electronic messages (without an unsubscribe facility). 
      This agreement operates indefinitely. However, you can tell us that you no longer wish us to use or disclose your personal information for these 
      purposes by contacting us on 1300 763 738 <br/>
      <b>Information about other persons </b><br/>
      (k) If you provide information about any other person, such as a referee, you agree
      to tell them: <br/>
      (i) that you are providing this information to us; (ii) of our contact details on 
      this form; <br/>
      (ii) the reason you are providing their information; <br/>
      <b>Electronic communication </b><br/>
      (l) To protect your privacy, we recommend that any email address you provide to us be your personal email address rather than, for example, an 
      email address accessible by your work colleagues or family members. </br>
      <b>Your access to personal Information correction and complaints </b><br/>
      (m) You have rights to request access to, or correction of, personal information that we hold about you, including credit‐related information. You 
      also have rights to make a complaint if you consider that we have not complied with the Privacy Act or Credit Reporting Privacy Code in relation to 
      our information. Our Privacy Policy and Credit Reporting Policy  <a href="www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au">www.nexgenequipmentrentals.com.au</a>

                    relation to any goods (“Goods”) that Customer may submit to the 
                    Financier a completed Rental Schedule in the form of the Schedule or 
                    in such other form as the Financier may require (a “Rental Schedule”) 
                    in respect of a Rental transaction.<br /> 
                    1.2 The submission of a Schedule by a Customer will constitute an 
                    irrevocable offer from that Customer to Rental (an “Offer”), for the 
                    term and for the payments set out in that Schedule and on the terms 
                    and conditions of this Agreement. <br /><br />

                    Offer, by signing the relevant Schedule, even if the Customer has 
                    prepaid any amount. The Customer is bound to rent once the 
                    Financier signs that Schedule. <br />

                    a Schedule comprises the terms set out in that Schedule, any Special 
                    Conditions set out or referred to in it, and the applicable provisions of 
                    this Agreement. <br />

                    supplier before the date the Financier signs a Schedule, then the 
                    Customer must comply with its obligations under this Agreement, 
                    without binding the Financier to an Agreement, from the time that the 
                    Customer takes delivery of the Goods, as if the Agreement had 
                    commenced at that time. <br /><br />

                    <b> C 3. Authorised Signatories</b> <br />

                    (a) sign Schedules; <br />
                    (b) agree to any Special Conditions which the Financier requires; <br />

                    (d) anything else in relation to this document or any transaction under 
                    this document. <br /><br />

                    <b>D 4. Warranties</b> <br />
                    4.1 When the Customer submits a Schedule, the Customer warrants 
                    that: <br />
                    (a) all information referred to in that Schedule and each document

                    (b) the execution and performance of this document and each

                    with its interest in the Goods (subject only to the rights of the 
                    Customer under this Agreement) or all or any part of the Financier’s 
                    rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of the 
                    Customer. The Customer must not assign, transfer or otherwise deal 
                    with any of its rights under this Agreement without the Financier’s 
                    prior written consent. <br />

                    without prejudice to its rights, powers and remedies with respect to 
                    any antecedent breach by the Customer under this Agreement. All 
                    rights of the Financier under this Agreement are in addition to its 
                    rights under the general law. <br />

                    Financier containing statements as to an amount due by the Customer 
                    under this Agreement, the occurrence of any event or the existence of 
                    any fact, will be sufficient evidence of the amount, event or fact, 
                    unless they are manifestly untrue. Customer agrees that in enforcing 
                    any PPS Security Interest provided for by this Agreement, the 
                    Financier has recourse to and may satisfy any of the Customer’s 
                    liability out of the Trust assets. <br />
                    14.4 Product Information The Customer requests the Financier to 
                    provide it from time to time with information on its other products or 
                    services. <br />
                    14.5 Financial Information The Customer must provide on demand the 
                    Financier with any financial or other information relating to its

                    14.6 Notices Any notice or demand to be given by the Financier under 
                    this Agreement may be served on the Customer by being left at or

                    in the Schedule or otherwise as notified in writing to the Financier. 
                    The notice or demand will be treated as having been given and 
                    received: <br />
                    (a) if delivered, on the day of delivery; <br />

                    (c) if transmitted by facsimile, on the day of transmission if a Business 
                    Day, or otherwise on the next Business Day. <br />
                    14.7 Overdue Payments The Customer must pay to the Financier on 
                    demand interest calculated by reference to the lesser of it’s then

                    Agreement which are overdue on a daily basis for the respective 
                    periods from the date the amounts became due to the date of 
                    payment and such amount shall compound monthly. If a liability 
                    under this Agreement becomes merged in a judgment order, the 
                    Customer, as an independent obligation, must pay interest on the 
                    amount of that liability from the date the liability becomes payable 
                    both before and after the judgment order, or winding up until it is 
                    paid, also at that rate. <br />
                    14.8 No Waiver No waiver by the Financier in relation to any breach of 
                    this Agreement by the Customer will be deemed a waiver of any 
                    continuing or recurring breach. <br />
                    14.9 Commission The Customer consents to the Financier paying a 
                    commission to any third party in relation to this Agreement. The 
                    Customer acknowledges that any third party which submitted this 
                    Agreement to the Financier is not and was not the Financier’s agent 
                    for any purpose and is the Customer’s agent. Commission may be 
                    included in the cost of the Goods. <br />

                    Financier to complete and amend any blank, incomplete or inaccurate

                    necessary formalities to render this Agreement complete and 
                    enforceable. <br />
                    14.11 Financier May Act On Omissions If the Customer neglects to pay 
                    any amount or take any other action required by this Agreement, the 
                    Financier may pay that amount or take that other action and recover 
                    such costs from the Customer. The Financier may enter and remain 
                    upon any land or premises for this purpose. <br />
                    14.12 Set‐Off The Customer irrevocably authorises the Financier to 
                    set‐off without notice any amount held by the Financier on any 
                    account of the Customer against any amount owing by the Customer 
                    to the Financier or any related body corporate of the Financier. The 
                    Customer must not exercise any right of set‐off on any account.<br /> 
                    14.13 Trust Provisions If the Customer enters into this Agreement as a 
                    trustee, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that it enters into this

                    for all of the obligations under this Agreement as well as in its capacity 
                    as trustee of any trust. <br />

                    found to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, it will have no

                    include serial numbered property, it has provided the Financier with 
                    the serial numbers that the Financier would require to make an 
                    effective registration (with the priority required by the Financier) 
                    against all such serial numbered property in accordance with the PPSA

                        18.1 On expiry of the Term (or on expiry of any Extended Term or 
                        Holding Over Period, as applicable, under clauses 18.3 or 18.4), the 
                        Customer must:  <br />
                        (a) at its cost, immediately deliver up the Goods in the condition and 
                        manner required under clause 18.1(a) to the Financier at a place 
                        directed by the Financier together with a duly executed transfer or 
                        certificate of registration (where applicable) and such records 
                        regarding the Goods as are required by the Financier, and if the 
                        Customer does not do so, the Financier may repossess the Goods; <br />
                        (b) pay the Financier on demand all other amounts then due and 
                        payable under this Agreement; <br />
                        (c) pay the Financier on demand, by way of liquidated damages, an 
                        amount equal to the average daily Payment payable by the Customer 
                        during the Term for each day the Customer fails to deliver up the 
                        Goods in accordance with clause 18.1(a) or until the Financier retakes 
                        possession of the Goods; <br />
                        (d) pay the Financier on demand its Costs of Repossession. <br />
                        18.2 The Customer undertakes to give the Financier no more than 180 
                        days and no less than 90 days prior written notice of its intention to 
                        terminate the Rental <br />
                        of the Goods at the end of the Term and any extension of the Term. <br />
                        18.3 If the Customer fails to give the notice required under clause 18.2 
                        or if the Customer gives that notice and it does not return the Goods 
                        to the Financier in the condition required under clause 18.1(a) at the 
                        expiration of the Term and the Financier has not terminated this 
                        Agreement, then the term of this Agreement will be automatically 
                        extended for a further period of 180 days (“Extended Term”) during 
                        which period the Rental of the Goods will continue at a Rental 
                        equivalent to the periodic Rental payable by the Customer 
                        immediately before the expiry of the Term and otherwise on the same 
                        terms and conditions as set out in this Agreement. <br />
                        18.4 If the Term is extended under clause 18.3 and the Customer fails 
                        to return the Goods at the expiration of the Extended Term in the 
                        manner required under clause 18.1(a), then the Term of this 
                        Agreement shall be extended from month to month (the “Holding 
                        Over Period”) during which period the Rental of the Goods will 
                        continue at the same periodic Rental and otherwise on the same 
                        terms and conditions as set out in this Agreement. <br />
                        18.5 The Holding Over Period may be terminated by the Financier 
                        demanding possession of the Goods at any time or by the Customer 
                        giving the Financier one month’s notice and delivering the Goods to 
                        the Financier in the manner required under clause 18.1(a). <br />
                        18.6 Payment of additional Rental instalments by the Customer under 
                        clauses 18.3 and 18.4 will not affect the Financier’s ownership of the 
                        Goods or any of its rights under this Agreement. <br />
